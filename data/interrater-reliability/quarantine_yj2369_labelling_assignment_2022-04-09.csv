That leaves us with another slow week. The Suez situation appears to be headed to a resolution. It’s a holiday-shortened week due to Good Friday, though non-farm payrolls will be released on Friday anyway and the bond market is open for half of the day. But non-farms have been kind of meh lately and many investors say the weekly jobless claims are a better gauge of the employment picture.

One thing to look to is this Biden infrastructure plan and accompanying stimulus package (yes, another one). That will be announced on Wednesday. It will apparently be paid for by tax increases on businesses and the wealthy, which may not be greeted well by the market.
