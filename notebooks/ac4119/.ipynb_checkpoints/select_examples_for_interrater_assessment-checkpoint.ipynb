We see the sails of the enemy approaching. Soon now, we will meet them face-to-face. I am resolved, in the midst and heat of the battle, to live or die amongst you all. While we stand together no invader shall pass. Let them come with the armies of Hell; they will not pass! And when this day of battle is ended, we meet again in Heaven or on the field of victory.   \n",

       "5             Hey guys, I want you to do something for me:\\n\\nThink back about a decade ago.  Occupy Wall Street is at its peak.  You’re feeling a similar hope to what you’re feeling now.  People are standing up against the big Wall Street assholes, and it’s a nationwide phenomenon.  It seems like a revolution.  Something might finally change.\\n\\nBut it doesn’t.  Eventually, people just have to leave, because Wall Street literally drank champagne and laughed at us as we shook our fists at them from the street. Nothing fundamentally changed, because they don’t give a shit about us.  We’re not people to them.\\n\\nFast forward to now.  We are in the midst of the actual revolution.  These motherfuckers aren’t drinking champagne now.  If they are, their flutes are shaking as they raise them to their lips.  It’s a comfort.  Because they are finally having the fight taken to them where it matters:  their fucking wallets.\\n\\nThey are losing their fucking minds.  They’re manipulating the market.  Manipulating the media.  They’re sending bots and writing comments trying to kill our vibes.  They think they can trick us into going home again.  Well, guess what...\\n\\n**I’M NOT FUCKING LEAVING.**\\n\\nWe can literally change a nation if we just HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. I love each and every one of you fucking retards, and even more importantly, I trust you.  We are in this together.  FUCK Wall Street.  Diamond hands motherfuckers!  💎🙌💎🙌\\n\\nI mean this when I say this, and this is the concept that scares them the fucking most:\\n\\n**Apes.  Together.  Strong.** 🦍🦍🦍🦍   \n",
