WSB: ""OMG another red week?! I'm shocked! SHOCKED!!""","The meteor already hit. The ruling class realize the size of the global population is leading to extreme levels of technological development and cultivation of information on a societal level that is rapidly eating their ancient power structures and brainwashing mechanisms alive and they have to cull big problematic portions of that global population and reduce its size before they lose control in order to stay safe from retribution for their crimes. They will collapse society themselves because it was already going to collapse and kill them and they'd rather kill than get killed. They're using the arctic as a weapon to decimate agriculture and water resources worldwide and they're preparing for the global war caused by billions of people dying to resource limitations. They refuse to get rid of their nukes because they think they might be able to use them as a last resort in that war. I used to hope for collapse so that I could go from being ostracized to being useful for my intelligence, now that collapse is here and it's clear my enemies were surprisingly causing it on purpose I've gone from being excited for it to just focusing on trying to mitigate it and hoping I don't get nuked or shot or anything.",Lol same except puts,0,0,0,0,0,0

If a stock is bleeding out slowly over weeks or months but you think it's going to recover over time you buy the dips. It all depends on how much ammo you have on the sidelines to buy.

The obvious answer is you wait until the stock hits its lowest point and buy it all at once but that's really hard to do in practice.","SGNX is gonna moonshot soon.
