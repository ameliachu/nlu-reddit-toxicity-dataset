3,So emotional decision it is then. Good day to you.,"Nice realization. I am no full autist and knew I missed the ship so I did not get on board but the moral of of this post is simple - you as an individual have to know when you as an individual are beat (your entries/exits) and no one, including your wife’s boyfriend does not give a shit if your money printer broke or if you burned a hole in your wallet. \n\nIn terms of WSB I’ve only been here a year but I’m not excited about the future of this sub.","Bought it at 100 avg and 9 avg (GME and AMC), and maybe I shoulda flaired loss porn?

You’re feeling a similar hope to what you’re feeling now. People are standing up against the big Wall Street assholes, and it’s a nationwide phenomenon. It seems like a revolution. Something might finally change.\n\nBut it doesn’t. Eventually, people just have to leave, because Wall Street literally drank champagne and laughed at us as we shook our fists at them from the street. Nothing fundamentally changed, because they don’t give a shit about us. We’re not people to them.\n\nFast forward to now. We are in the midst of the actual revolution. These motherfuckers aren’t drinking champagne now. If they are, their flutes are shaking as they raise them to their lips. It’s a comfort. Because they are finally having the fight taken to them where it matters: their fucking wallets.\n\nThey are losing their fucking minds. They’re manipulating the market. Manipulating the media. They’re sending bots and writing comments trying to kill our vibes. They think they can trick us into going home again. Well, guess what...\n\n**I’M NOT FUCKING LEAVING.**\n\nWe can literally change a nation if we just HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. I love each and every one of you fucking retards, and even more importantly, I trust you. We are in this together. FUCK Wall Street. Diamond hands motherfuckers! 💎🙌💎🙌\n\nI mean this when I say this, and this is the concept that scares them the fucking most:\n\n**Apes. Together. Strong.** 🦍🦍🦍🦍",The loss porn will be epic,0,0,0,1,1,0
