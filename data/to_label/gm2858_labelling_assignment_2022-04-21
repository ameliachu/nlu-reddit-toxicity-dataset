Who else is getting money on the best kept secret of WSB today?",Just wait until he speaks,,,,,,
99048,[Idk you tell me](https://www.reddit.com/r/HairyAssGirls/),"Depends.. If a stock tanks and you think it's a fake tank it's best to buy a lot at once hoping you are buying at the bottom. If a stock is bleeding out slowly over weeks or months but you think it's going to recover over time you buy the dips. It all depends on how much ammo you have on the sidelines to buy. 

The obvious answer is you wait until the stock hits its lowest point and buy it all at once but that's really hard to do in practice.","SGNX is gonna moonshot soon.
