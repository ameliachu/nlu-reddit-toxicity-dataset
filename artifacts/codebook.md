### Additional Guidelines

- in WSB, a declarative statement, doesn’t necessarily shut down dialogue.

**toxicity**

It’s more likely to be toxic when:

1. It’s directed toward an individual.
2. If I read that comment, I would would feel sad or upset
3. Err on the side of toxicity, but still profanity != toxicity

**profanity**

- any acronyms of profanity = profanity

**identity_attack**

- If the word (by general consensus e.g. quick google search) is a “slur”, then it’s an identity_attack, if it is considered as just “vulgar”, it is not an identity attack.
